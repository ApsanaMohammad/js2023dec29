What are the Types of JavaScript Literals?
Javascript literals hold different types of values. Examples of JavaScript Literals are given below:

1. Integer Literals
Integer literals are numbers that must have a minimum of one digit (0-9).
 No blank or comma is allowed within an integer. It can store positive numbers or negative numbers.
  JavaScript supports integer literals in three different bases.
   The base 10 is Decimal (Decimal numbers contain digits (0,9) );
    examples for Decimal numbers are 234, -56, 10060. Second is base 8,
     Octal (Octal numbers contain digits (0,7) and leading 0 indicates octal), 0X 073, -089, 02003. 
     Third is base 16, that is, Hexadecimal numbers (Hexadecimal numbers contain (0,9) digits and (A, F) or (a, f) 
     letters and leading 0x or 0X indicate the number is hexadecimal); examples for hexadecimal numbers are 0X8b, – 0X89, 0X2003.


     2. Floating Number Literals
Floating numbers are decimal or fraction numbers or can have an exponent part. 
Examples of hexadecimal numbers are 78.90, -234.90, 78.6e4, etc.

3. String Literals
A string literals are a sequence of zero or more characters. A string literals are either enclosed in the single quotation or double quotation as (‘) and (“) respectively, and to concatenate two or more strings, we can use the + operator. 
Examples for string are “hello”, “hello world”, “123”, “hello” + “world” etc.


4. Array Literals
Array literals comprise a list of expressions or constant values, with each expression referred to as an array element.
 An array literal contains a list of elements within square brackets’ [ ]’.
  Suppose no value is a pass when it creates an empty array with zero length.
   If elements are passed, its length is set to the number of elements passed. 
   String examples are var color = [ ], var fruits = [“Apple”, “Orange”, “Mango”, “Banana”] (an array of four elements).

   5. Boolean Literals
Boolean literals in JavaScript have only two literal values, that are true and false.

Let us understand with an example code.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset= "utf-8" >
<title> This is an example for Boolean literals </title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>JavaScript Boolean </h1>
<p> Boolean Examples are : </p>
<script>
document.write('Boolean(12) is ' + Boolean(12));
document.write('<br>');
document.write('Boolean("Hello") is ' + Boolean("Hello"));
document.write('<br>');
document.write('Boolean(2 > 3) is ' + Boolean(2 > 3));
document.write('<br>');
document.write('Boolean(3 > 2) is ' + Boolean(3 > 2));
document.write('<br>');
document.write('Boolean(-12) is ' + Boolean(-12));
document.write('<br>');
document.write("Boolean('true') is " + Boolean('true'));
document.write('<br>');
document.write("Boolean('false') is " + Boolean('false'));
document.write('<br>');
document.write('Boolean(0) is ' + Boolean(0));
</script>
</body>
</html>
Output:

Output-1.5
6. Object Literals
Object literals are collections of zero or more key-value pairs of a comma-separated list, enclosed by a pair of curly braces ‘{ } ‘.Examples of an object literal with a declaration are var userObject = { }, var student = { f-name : “John”, l-name : “D”, “rno”: 23, “marks”: 60}
